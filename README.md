# Thesis
Year 4 thesis project, modified the QBF solver coded in TOR

1. 1/6/2021: refactor the code, seperate into different packages

2. 3/6/2021: implement the backjumping trick

3. 11/6/2021: The implementation of the backjumping trick is complete for both the QDLL solver and the PNS solver,
all shows some not insignficant improvement. 

4. 14/6/2021: Update the "R" function for the deepPNS, significant improvement shown for the DeepPNS solver.
This shows a very signicicant improvement in the simpler gttt4x4 instances, half of the instances were solved by this little modification.
